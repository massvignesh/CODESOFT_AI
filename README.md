# Tic Tac Toe Game with AI

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game where you play against an AI opponent. The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make its moves.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or download the `tictactoe.py` file.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the `tictactoe.py` file using Python.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to make your moves by entering a number from 0 to 8 corresponding to the cell you want to mark.
5. The game ends when either you or the AI wins, or the board is filled with no winner (draw).
